What kind of hatred could make a man stab a baby crying out for his mother's milk,
What kind of 'clearance operation' is this? What national security goals could possibly be served by this?
I don't think there is ethnic cleansing going on,
I think ethnic cleansing is too strong an expression to use for what is happening.
It is Muslims killing Muslims, as well, if they think they are collaborating with authorities.
It is not just a matter of ethnic cleansing. It is a matter of people on different sides of a divide, and this divide we are trying to close up. As best as possible and not to widen it further,
not free to rape, pillage and torture
They are free to go in and fight. And of course, that is in the constitution ... Military matters are to be left to the army,
if they come back they will be safe

Hounded and ridiculed for complaining of rape Truth, lies and Aung San Suu Kyi Who are the Rohingya? Rohingya villages 'destroyed' in Myanmar The Rohingya are denied citizenship in Myanmar, also known as Burma, which views them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. They face routine official and public discrimination. Tens of thousands of Rohingya live in makeshift refugee camps after being displaced by communal violence in 2012. The leader of Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, has given a wide ranging interview to the BBC's Fergal Keane In recent months, some 70,000 have fled to Bangladesh to escape a government military operation in Rakhine, launched after nine policemen were killed in an attack. The United Nations announced last month it was to conduct an investigation into allegations the military has been indiscriminately targeting the Rohingya during the operation, subjecting them to rape, murder and torture. The government has denied this. For many, Ms Suu Kyi's perceived silence on the Rohingya has damaged the reputation she earned as a beacon for human rights, thanks to her decadeslong battle against the military junta, during much of which she was under house arrest. She has come under increasing pressure internationally on the issue. But speaking in a facetoface interview for the first time this year, Ms Suu Kyi said she had answered questions on the issue previously.
And they [the journalists] would ask me questions and I would answer them and people would say I said nothing.
Ms Suu Kyi said she had no idea why the October attacks were carried out, but speculated it may have been an effort to derail attempts to negotiate peace between the Myanmar state and the country's various armed ethnic insurgent groups. She also denied the army had free rein to do whatever it liked.
However, she did acknowledge that regaining control of the military was something the government still hoped to do. Under the current constitution, the military operates independently of the governing party. From icon to politician: Fergal Keane, BBC News in Myanmar I meet her in Nay Pyi Daw, a relic of the absurdity and paranoia of military rule, a capital marooned far from the people, designed to keep the generals safe but where the new democratic government is now trying to consolidate a hold on power. I first interviewed Aung San Suu Kyi more than two decades ago on her release from the first period of house arrest in July 1995. Since then I have followed her progress through renewed house arrest, military crackdowns and then the triumph of democratic elections last year. The atmosphere when we met was friendly. She discussed her government's achievements but refused absolutely to accept that the Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine state were the victims of ethnic cleansing. These days she is wary of the international media, disdainful of her international critics, far more the steely politician than the global icon feted from capital to capital when she was released seven years ago. Ms Suu Kyi also defended the progress her government had made since sweeping to power in March last year. The number one priority creating jobs had been helped by investment into roads, bridges and bringing electricity to communities. Healthcare has also improved, and more free elections have been held. Other priorities included creating a peace in a country which has almost continuously been in a state of civil war. And then there was discussion of giving citizenship to those who had been denied it under the military junta like the Rohingya. As for those Rohingya who have fled Myanmar to neighbouring countries, Ms Suu Kyi said:
We welcome them and we will welcome them back.

I've never seen anything like it, beyond description,
I'm not calling it a wall because we are talking about a fence that we can look through. That's what we need.
I think fencing has worked for us in the past, but you never want to have a barrier in place that will obstruct your vision, that prevents you from seeing the other side of the border.
These are law enforcement agencies. When the White House says 'Jump,' they will say 'How high?' But there will be whispers from them to Congress saying not to do this,
It's going to be made of hardened concrete, and it's going to be made out of rebar, and steel,
On the fenceâ€”it's not a fence. It's a wall. You just misreported it. We're going to build a wall.

President Trump's promise to build a 2000-mile big beautiful wall
The President, Congressman, has asked me to take a look at what we need at the Southwest Border and come up with recommendation to him. Yes, there are many places that we need some types of physical barrier right now backed up by men and women at the border protection.
It is the policy of the executive branch to secure the southern border of the United States through the immediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border, monitored and supported by adequate personnel so as to prevent illegal immigration, drug and human trafficking, and acts of terrorism.
'Wall' shall mean a contiguous, physical wall or other simeilarly secure, contiguous, and impassable physical barrier.

senseless and heartless brutality
Today's chemical attack in Syria against innocent people, including women and children, is reprehensible and cannot be ignored by the civilized world. These heinous actions by the Bashar al-Assad regime are a consequence of the past administration's weakness and irresolution. President Obama said in 2012 that he would establish a
against the use of chemical weapons and then did nothing. The United States stands with our allies across the globe to condemn this intolerable attack.
While we continue to monitor the terrible situation, it is clear that this is how Bashar al-Assad operates: with brutal, unabashed barbarism. Those who defend and support him, including Russia and Iran, should have no illusions about Assad or his intentions. Anyone who uses chemical weapons to attack his own people shows a fundamental disregard for human decency and must be held accountable.
Our team is still there, moving patients from one place to another because of overcrowded hospitals,

Because of the number of wounded, they have been distributed around in rural Idlib,
There are 18 critical cases here. They were unconscious, they had seizures and when oxygen was administered, they bled from the nose and mouth.
Chlorine gas doesn't cause such convulsions,
If it is the case that it has been conducted by the Assad regime, it shows the barbarism of that regime and what I would say is all those who are backing that regime, including Russia, need to use their influence to stop Assad from bombarding and dealing with his people in such a horrific way,
war crime of the worst sort

Jesus Christ, Jehovah, Allah. These are all names employed to describe an entity that is distinctly the same across the world. For centuries, blood has been needlessly shed because of the desire to segregate our faiths. This, however, should be the very concept which unites us as people, as nations, and as a world bound by faith. Together, we can bring about an unprecedented age of peace, all we need to achieve such a state is respect each others beliefs, for we are all children of God regardless of the name we choose to address him by. We can accomplish miraculous things in the world by merging our faiths, and the time for such a movement is now. No longer shall we slaughter our neighbors over differences in reference to their God.

For the people who have already made up their minds, it probably won't change anything.

And he said to quote him very clearly: ï¿½They may have been phony in the past, but it's very real now.ï¿½ï¿½  Some reporters laughed.  Alexander, however, was determined to return to the statement on Monday and began by asking: ï¿½When should Americans trust the president? Should they trust the president? Is it phony or real when he says that [he] was wiretapped?ï¿½  Spicer focused on only the last question about Trumpï¿½s March 4 tweets accusing Obama of wiretapping him in a ï¿½Nixon/Watergateï¿½ scheme ï¿½ which the White House has been unable to prove with any evidence ï¿½ by conceding, for the first time, that the president hadnï¿½t meant his words to be entirely taken literally.  ï¿½He doesnï¿½t really think that President Obama went up and tapped his phone personally,ï¿½ Spicer said.  When Alexander asked Spicer why Trump was willing to trust the CBOï¿½s projections about Obamacare three years ago but no longer trusts its forecasts pertaining to the GOP replacement bill the White House supports, the press secretary defended the presidentï¿½s position without commenting on the inherent conflict.  After another lengthy back and forth, Alexander crystallized his question in a way Spicer could no longer dodge.  ï¿½The bottom line isï¿½the question that you still have not answered isï¿½can you say affirmatively that whenever the president says something, we can trust it be real?ï¿½ Alexander asked.  ï¿½If heï¿½s not joking, of course,ï¿½ Spicer said. ï¿½Every time that he speaks authoritatively, heï¿½s speaking as president of the United States.ï¿½  Alexander countered another controversial and unfounded claim the president has made about voter fraud: ï¿½When he says 3 to 5 million Americans voted illegally, was he joking or does he believe that?ï¿½  ï¿½Yes, and he still believes that,ï¿½ Spicer said. ï¿½He does believe it.ï¿½  On Monday, two hours after the briefing ended, the CBO released its score of the GOP Obamacare repeal bill, projecting that 24 million Americans would lose their health insurance by the year 2026 if the legislation were enacted.  At the briefing, Spicer attempted to preemptively question the accuracy of CBO projections. ï¿½The last time they did this, they were wildly off,ï¿½ he said.

We will see more conflict in Syria. We will see more pictures that we can never unsee.
The main task now is to have an objective inquiry into what happened,

My attitude towards Syria and Assad has changed very much,
As a presidential candidate he could not have been more clear that he wanted to avoid military involvement in the Syrian civil war,
For him to order military strikes, even limited military strikes, in response to the chemical attack in Idlib, would be a gigantic change and not one that I'm at all sure that the administration is actually going to do.
I find it laughable that governments such as Russia would suggest that rebels have a chemical weapons capacity but they always seem to use it on their own people and never on the Syrian army,
I now have responsibility,
That responsibility could be made a lot easier if it was handled years ago.
They have to disambiguate and they have to make sure that they donï¿½t hurt any Russian soldiers,
But thereï¿½s a wide palette of things they can do. They can bomb airports and destroy the runways so that Syrian planes canï¿½t fly for some time, they could kill a bunch of Syrian soldiers, they could destroy command centresï¿½we'll have to wait and see.
[Trump's] entire policy for the Middle East has been based on reversing the notion of regime change. He supports strong men,
Now that he's got a strong man in Assad who is violating human rights and this norm of not using chemical weapons, he has to calibrate his policy and try to insist on human rights even as he supports dictators.

Mr de BrettonGordon also noted that chlorine was the only chemical believed to been used in attacks in Aleppo over the past year.

Hasan Haj Ali, commander of the Free Idlib Army rebel group, called Russia's claim a

The UK's representative to the UN, Matthew Rycroft, also told the Security Council that his country had seen nothing to suggest that any nonstate actors in Syria had the sort of chemical weapons that would have been consistent with the symptoms. Francois Delattre of France meanwhile said there was

. It was also not clear why there was several hours' difference between the time of the strike reported by multiple witnesses and that stated by Russia. Moscow's short account gave no evidence for its suggestion that a group was sending chemical weaponry to Iraq. The socalled Islamic State group, which has used sulphur mustard in Syria and Iraq, is not present in Khan Sheikhoun. Why is there a war in Syria? What is Sarin? Sarin is highly toxic and considered 20 times as deadly as cyanide. As with all nerve agents, Sarin inhibits the action of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme, which deactivates signals that cause human nerve cells to fire. This blockage pushes nerves into a continual
state. The heart and other muscles including those involved in breathing spasm. Sufficient exposure can lead to death via asphyxiation within minutes. Sarin is almost impossible to detect because it is a clear, colourless and tasteless liquid that has no odour in its purest form. It can also evaporate and spread through the air. Has Sarin been used in Syria before? The Syrian government was accused by Western powers of firing rockets filled with Sarin at several rebelheld suburbs of the capital Damascus in August 2013, killing hundreds of people. President Bashar alAssad denied the charge, blaming rebel fighters, but he did subsequently agree to destroy Syria's declared chemical arsenal. Despite that, the OPCW and UN have continued to document the use of chemicals in attacks. A joint investigation concluded in October that government forces had used chlorine as a weapon at least three times between 2014 and 2015. It also found Islamic State militants had used the blister agent sulphur mustard.
